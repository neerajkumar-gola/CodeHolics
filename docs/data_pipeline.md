## FAERS Data Pipeline

- FAERS 2021 Q1–Q4 ASCII datasets were used.
- Data ingestion was automated via directory traversal.
- To avoid data explosion, reactions and outcomes were aggregated at case level.
- Severity scores were derived from FAERS outcome codes.
- The final dataset supports adverse event prediction from conversation data.
